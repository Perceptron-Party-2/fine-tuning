(crying) This cage is too small.,"Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!"
"Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)",Oh!
"No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and he's able to fly.",Hey! I can fly!
He can talk!,"Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.) He hits the ground with a thud."
"Oh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and begins walking back to his cottage.","Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!"
Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!,"Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that."
"Oh, that's great. Really.","Man, it's good to be free."
"Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?","But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us. Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very loudly."
Why are you following me?,"Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day."
Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.,"I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith..."
"Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?",Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.
"No! I'm an ogre! You know. ""Grab your torch and pitchforks."" Doesn't that bother you?",(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really tall?
Really?,Nope.
Oh.,"Really, really."
"Uh, Shrek.","Man, I like you. What's you name?"
That would be my home.,"Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that?"
I like my privacy.,"Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you?"
"Uh, what?","You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?"
(sarcastically) Of course!,"Can I stay with you, please?"
No.,Really?
Okay! Okay! But one night only.,"Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!"
What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No! No!,Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
Oh!,"This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles."
(irritated) Outside!,"Where do, uh, I sleep?"
(to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside.,"Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me..."
"All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there. (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey)",(from the window) I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
(heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.,"Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them."
Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?,"Oh, I do. I know where he is."
Anyone?,Me! Me!
"(sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me.","Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!"
What did I say about singing?,"All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!"
No.,"(singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again."
"Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly) DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.",Can I whistle?
"So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.",Can I hum it?
"Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.)",But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?,Uh-huh. That's the place.
"Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.","Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek."
All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.,"Hey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin to sing."
No? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on! He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice to say that Shrek kicks butt.,Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again)
What kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.,Sorry about that.
"You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.","Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd."
"Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?",Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?
"For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.","I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip."
"Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. (he holds out his onion)","Uh, no, not really, no."
Yes - - No!,Example?
No!,(sniffs the onion) They stink?
No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he heaves a sigh and then walks off),They make you cry?
I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes.,"You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs."
"No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.","(trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers."
"You know, I think I preferred your humming.","You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, ""Let's get some parfait,"" they say, ""Hell no, I don't like no parfait""? Parfaits are delicious."
Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.,Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.
"Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We must be getting close.","Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering. They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out."
"Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. (laughs...then the laugh turns into a groan)",(sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open and everything.
"Oh, aye.","Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither. They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very foreboding."
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.,"Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers?"
You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.,"Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves."
"Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time.",You know what I mean.
"Really, really.","No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava!"
Just keep moving. And don't look down.,Really?
But you're already halfway.,"Okay, that makes me feel so much better."
"Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.","Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down. (he steps through a rotting board and ends up looking straight down into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!"
"Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? (bounces and sways the bridge)",But I know that half is safe!
"Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces the bridge again)","Shrek, no! Wait!"
"Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across the bridge)",Don't do that!
You said do it! I'm doin' it.,"Yes, that!"
"That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks towards the castle)","No, Shrek! No! Stop it!"
"Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. (chuckles)","I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) Oh!"
,Cool. So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?
No.,"I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek."
Shh.,You afraid?
"Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.",But...
(putting on a helmet) The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.,"Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that."
I read it in a book once. (walks off),Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.
Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.,What makes you think she'll be there?
"Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the...",Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'. (walks off)
"Donkey, look out! (he manages to get a hold of the dragons tail and holds on) Got ya! The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying on the floor.",I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.
One of a kind. (opens the door into the throne room),(os) Dragon! Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon breathes fire.
"(sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) You're - - You're wonderful. You're... (turns and sees Shrek fall down the hill and bump into Donkey) a little unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed is great, and thy heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears his throat.) And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?",Oh! Aah! Aah! Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small part of the bridge he's on.
What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the job description.,"No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, what large teeth you have. (the dragon growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes at him) What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon blows a smoke ring in the shape of a heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him up with her teeth and carries him off) No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!"
"No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.","(os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs worriedly) (we see him up close and from a distance as Shrek sneaks into the room) I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards - - I'd really love to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh! Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her."
"Well, yes. Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.","Hi, Princess!"
"But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his- - his pet.",I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
"Ya comin', Donkey?",Maybe it's a perk.
A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.,Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you true love?
You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your...(Shrek drops her on the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.,You think Shrek is your true love!
"Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. (he and Donkey laugh) Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off the dust and grime.","Well, so much for noble steed."
But there's robbers in the woods.,I'm right behind ya.
Hey! Over here.,"Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?"
"A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. (goes into the cave and puts the bark door up behind her)","You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!"
(os) I said good night! Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona still inside.,"I don't know. There are those who think little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad."
"And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.","Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting to sound good."
"The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.","Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess."
"No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.",You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.
"You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.","Shrek, What are you doing?"
Our swamp?,"Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?"
"We? Donkey, there's no ""we"". There's no ""our"". There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.",I know you're making this up.
"No, do ya think?",That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.
"Never mind, Donkey.","(heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?"
"No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.","You know, when we're through rescuing the princess."
Why do you want to talk about it?,"You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out."
I'm not blocking.,Are you hidin' something?
"Donkey, I'm warning you.","Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?"
Everyone! Okay?,Why don't you want to talk about it?
Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and walks over to the edge of the cliff and sits down),Why are you blocking?
"Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. ""Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.","Oh, yes, you are."
"Yeah, I know.",Who you trying to keep out?
"Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.","(pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. (grins) At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her."
That's the moon.,What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?
"Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking in his sleep.","You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre."
"Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)","So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?"
Wake up.,"Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there? Fiona puts the door back."
"Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?","Oh, okay. DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic Mirror shows him Princess Fiona."
They are once again on their way. They are walking through the forest. Shrek belches.,"(quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. Come on, baby. I said I like it."
"What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. (laughs)",Huh? What?
Thanks.,What? (stretches and yawns)
"Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.","Oh, good morning, Princess! Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them."
Shrek's hurt.,Shrek!
"Donkey, I'm okay.","Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess. Fiona belches"
"Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.",She's as nasty as you are.
Donkey!,(walking up) Why? What's wrong?
Donkey is still looking for the special flower.,"Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die."
(os) Ow!,"You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the Heimlich?"
Ow! Ohh! (he jerks and manages to fall over with Fiona on top of him),"Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!"
"(throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing happend. We were just, uh - -","Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. (runs off)"
"Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just- - (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he turns to look at Fiona who holds up the arrow with a smile) Ow!","Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns."
That's DuLoc?,"Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens to be a blue flower with red thorns)"
"I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good.",Ahem.
"Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.","Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?"
I'll get the firewood.,"Hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle) That's...is that blood? Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue on their way. There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc. Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc."
"I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) Are you gonna eat that?","Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really...(Shrek steps on his hoof) Ow!"
What?,What are you talking about? I'm fine.
"Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.","I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look, (turns his neck in a very sharp way until his head is completely sideways) Ow! See?"
Good night. Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks at Shrek with a new eye.,"Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug."
"Oh, what are you talkin' about?","(chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset."
You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.,"Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?"
"I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a princess, and I'm - -","Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until - - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark. Shrek sighs"
Yeah. An ogre.,Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.
Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is nowhere to be seen.,"I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it."
"Oh, no!","Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel."
Shh!,An ogre?
"No, it's okay. It's okay.","Hey, where you goin'?"
"Donkey, I'm the princess.","Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess? Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her."
"It's me, in this body.",It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games. Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking out.
Donkey!,Aah!
No!,"No, help!"
Shh.,Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
"This is me. Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets down.",What did you do with the princess?
"I'm ugly, okay?",Aah!
No. I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.,"Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to her stomach) Can you hear me?"
"It only happens when sun goes down. ""By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form.""","(still aimed at her stomach) Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!"
"It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this. (begins to cry)",Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
"But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look.",Shrek!
I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.,"Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different."
"Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.","Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - -"
No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.,"What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before."
Promise you won't tell. Promise!,"Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry."
"Yeah? Well, it does. (Fiona looks at him in shock. He looks past her and spots a group approaching.) Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something. Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers march by.","All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7."
"Fare-thee-well, ogre. Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches them go.","Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?"
Yeah? So what?,"But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you got a lot in common."
"I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?",You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
"I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!",What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?
Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! (stomps off),"All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. (goes outside) I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'. Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back inside the windmill."
Donkey? (Donkey ignores him and continues with what he's doing.) What are you doing?,What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (spots the soldiers) (muffled) Who said that? Couldn't have been the donkey.
"Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.","Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away."
Oh! Your half. Hmm.,"Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night, She's - -"
Back off!,"Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you."
This is my swamp!,But I thought - -
"(grabs the tree branch Donkey is working with) Let go, Donkey!",Shrek. Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.
Stubborn jackass!,"I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one."
Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks away),"It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half."
"Well, I'm through with you.","Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head."
"Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?","No, you back off."
"Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back! (goes into the outhouse and slams the door)",Our swamp.
(os) Go away!,You let go.
"(os) Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking.",Smelly ogre.
"(opens the door and comes out) She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?","Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet."
Donkey!,"Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, ""Me, me, me!"" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away."
"Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?",Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!
Right. Friends?,"Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings."
"So, um, what did Fiona say about me?","There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you."
The wedding! We'll never make it in time.,"She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else."
Donkey?,"Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. Right? Right?"
"Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a noogie)",No!
Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with a boom. The guards all take off running.,"Hey, that's what friends are for, right?"
(at the Church door) What are you talking about?,Friends.
I don't have time for this!,What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?
Yes.,"Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I have a way. (whistles) Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so they can climb on."
Yes.,I guess it's just my animal magnetism. They both laugh.
Yes!,"All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet. They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc."
All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?,"(to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? (she nods and goes after the guards) Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you?"
What do you see?,"There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace."" That's when you say, ""I object!"""
I now pronounce you husband and wife... Outside,"Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you?"
...king and queen. Outside,You wanna hold her?
I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon show up and the dragon leans down and eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!,Please her?
But you ARE beautiful. They smile at each other.,"(singing James Brown style) Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. (normal) The chicks love that romantic crap!"
"God bless us, every one.",We gotta check it out.
,The whole town's in there. Inside
,They're at the altar. Inside
,Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
,"All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. (The dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on the edge! The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth and falls to the ground."
,"Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? The congregation cheers."
,"Go ahead, Shrek."
,(chuckles) I was hoping this would be a happy ending. Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...
,"(as he's done singing and we fade to black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't breathe. I can't breathe."
